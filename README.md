# Vulkan-Engine-V1.0

*This repository does not include all the files required to run the project at the moment so it is not advised attempting to do so.*

--== To Build ==--

You will need the following libraries included in your project:

GLFW - https://www.glfw.org

GLM - https://github.com/g-truc/glm

Vulkan - https://vulkan.lunarg.com

stb_image.h - https://github.com/nothings/stb

Assimp - https://assimp.org/index.php/downloads

PhysX - https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX

Currently, if you want to run the project you will need to compile all the shaders into binaries with names corresponding to those found in Mesh.cpp.
Additionally you need 'default albedo.png', 'default normal.png', 'default roughness.png', 'default metalness', 'default ambient occlusion' aswell as required .dll files from the libraries listed above within the same folder as the executable.
